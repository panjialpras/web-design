                An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive test that records electrical activity in the brain. 
                It works by picking up abnormal brain waves via electrodes that are attached to the scalp. 
                EEGs are usually done to detect seizures and to diagnose epilepsy, 
                but they can be used to evaluate or diagnose other conditions, such as sleep disorders or brain injuries. 
                EEGs are also often used to monitor brain activity in someone who is in an induced coma or undergoing certain types of surgery. 
                An EEG may be ordered by a general practitioner or by a neurologistâ€”a doctor 
                who specializes in disorders that affect the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.

            <h2>Purpose of Test</h2>
            <p>
                Although the primary reason an EEG is done is to diagnose epilepsy, the test has many other uses. 
                These include looking for abnormal brain activity that may be caused by:
                <ul>
                    <li>A head injury</li>
                    <li>A brain tumor</li>
                    <li>An infection such as encephalitis (inflammation of the brain that's usually caused by a virus)</li>
                    <li>Stroke</li>
                    <li>Sleep disorders caused by seizures</li>
                </ul>
                Someone in a medically induced coma may have continual brain wave monitoring using an EEG to make sure 
                they're getting the correct level of anesthesia. A patient undergoing brain or vascular surgery may be monitored 
                with an EEG to make sure the surgery is not causing permanent damage. 
            </p>
            <h2>Before the Test</h2>
            <p>
                If you will be having an EEG, the following information will help you to prepare for the test.
            </p>
            <h3>Timing</h3>
            <p>
                The length of your encephalogram will depend on the type of test you're having. In general, 
                a routine EEG can take as little as 20 to 30 minutes as an outpatient procedure, 
                or as many as 24 hours to several days in a hospital, so that brain waves can be measured during sleep. 
                This is sometimes referred to as a prolonged or 24-hour EEG. In both cases, 
                allow extra time for checking in and test preparation (30 to 60 minutes should be sufficient). 
                An ambulatory EEG may be as short as a day or as many as three days. 
                Often EEGs are named based on the length of recording time required (two-hour EEG, 24-hour EEG). If your doctor doesn't tell you, 
                ask how long your test will last from start to finish, so you can plan accordingly.
            </p>
            <h3>Location</h3>
            <p>
                In most cases, an EEG test is an outpatient procedure performed in a doctor's office, hospital, lab, or clinic. 
                In some cases of extended monitoring, you may need to be admitted to the hospital for a few days. 
                If you have an ambulatory EEG, it will take place at home.
            </p>
            <h3>What to Wear</h3>
            <p>
                Since you'll be sitting or lying down for some time, you should wear something that allows you to do that comfortably. 
                Choose a top that buttons or zips up, so you don't have to pull anything over your head. You can wear jewelry, 
                but keep in mind that large or dangling earrings could get in the way depending on where the electrodes are placed. 
                If you're being admitted to the hospital overnight or for longer, you'll change into a hospital gown.
